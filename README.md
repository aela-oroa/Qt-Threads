# Qt-Threads
A Qt-based multithreaded application featuring a synchronized FIFO queue system. The app runs three background threads: one generates integers, another manages the queue with a limit of 20 elements, and the third consumes integers from the queue. The GUI allows for starting/stopping threads and displays real-time updates of generated, queued, and consumed integers.
